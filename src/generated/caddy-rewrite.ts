/**
 * Rewrite is a middleware which can rewrite/mutate HTTP requests.
 * The Method and URI properties are "setters" (the request URI
 * will be overwritten with the given values). Other properties are
 * "modifiers" (they modify existing values in a differentiable
 * way). It is atypical to combine the use of setters and
 * modifiers in a single rewrite.
 * To ensure consistent behavior, prefix and suffix stripping is
 * performed in the URL-decoded (unescaped, normalized) space by
 * default except for the specific bytes where an escape sequence
 * is used in the prefix or suffix pattern.
 * For all modifiers, paths are cleaned before being modified so that
 * multiple, consecutive slashes are collapsed into a single slash,
 * and dot elements are resolved and removed. In the special case
 * of a prefix, suffix, or substring containing "//" (repeated slashes),
 * slashes will not be merged while cleaning the path so that
 * the rewrite can be interpreted literally.
 */

   * Changes the request's URI, which consists of path and query string.
   * Only components of the URI that are specified will be changed.
   * For example, a value of "/foo.html" or "foo.html" will only change
   * the path and will preserve any existing query string. Similarly, a
   * value of "?a=b" will only change the query string and will not affect
   * the path. Both can also be changed: "/foo?a=b" - this sets both the
   * path and query string at the same time.
   * You can also use placeholders. For example, to preserve the existing
   * query string, you might use: "?{http.request.uri.query}&a=b". Any
   * key-value pairs you add to the query string will not overwrite
   * existing values (individual pairs are append-only).
   * To clear the query string, explicitly set an empty one: "?"

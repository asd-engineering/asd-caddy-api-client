/**
 * Handler is a middleware for HTTP/2 server push. Note that
 * HTTP/2 server push has been deprecated by some clients and
 * its use is discouraged unless you can accurately predict
 * which resources actually need to be pushed to the client;
 * it can be difficult to know what the client already has
 * cached. Pushing unnecessary resources results in worse
 * performance. Consider using HTTP 103 Early Hints instead.
 * This handler supports pushing from Link headers; in other
 * words, if the eventual response has Link headers, this
 * handler will push the resources indicated by those headers,
 * even without specifying any resources in its config.
